replace USERNAME and PASSWORD with your AirVPN credentials

./eddie-cli -connect -netlock.mode=Auto -login=USERNAME -password=PASSWORD 'proxy.tor.control.port=9051' 'proxy.port=9050' 'proxy.host=127.0.0.1' 'proxy.mode=tor'

Part four: turn it into service (run on startup)

Now with everything working grate, we need to make it run on boot:

1- Create file service:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/eddie.service

2- Copy the below service template:

replace USERNAME and PASSWORD with your AirVPN credentials
